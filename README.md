# OpenGLExperiments

Just a repository to hold whatever small OpenGL test programs I write

## Stenciltest 

A small program to see if Depth/Stencil attachements values are correctly written and read-back.

A compiled version of this program for Win64 that depends on the VS2013 runtime can be found [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!d0QWWTZJ!g8v3OPhd0Pd69vCpgujMK0Nw6qTsuKJSuoRQCXoMbIU)
